Player's tags must be manually assigned in code

Every object has a triggerId and can have up to 32 tags on them
    AKA each objectFunction can be activated by up to 32 different triggers
If bodyA has a tag for the triggerId of bodyB, that triggerId is activated
Each triggerId should only have 1 event associated with it
