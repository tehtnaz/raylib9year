Triggers: Any physObj with a trigger above 0 disables its dynamics (no solid collisions)

Tag = item entering a trigger
Reserved tags / trigger + recommended ranges
    (1):
        Tag     -> Crate (grabbable object)
        Trigger -> Player grab area
    (2):
        Tag     -> Player
        Trigger -> All triggers greater than 8
    (3):
        Tag     -> Player
        Trigger -> Next level
    (4): (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
        Tag     -> Player
        Trigger -> Death trigger
            Fade to black
    (13-16): (DO NOT CHANGE THESE TRIGGER IDS, IF YOU DO, CHANGE VALUE ADDED IN dataHandling IN parseStructGroupInfo)
        Tag     -> Player
        Trigger -> Portals
        
    (17-65)
        Tag     -> Player
        Trigger -> Button

    (65-129)
        Tag     -> Player
        Trigger -> Text prompt

    (130-131)
        Tag     -> Player
        Trigger -> Special conditional text for level 2 (if hit button while not in dimension / hit portal before button...)

Player's tags must be manually assigned in code

Every object has a triggerId and can have up to 32 tags on them
    AKA each objectFunction can be activated by up to 32 different triggers
If bodyA has a tag for the triggerId of bodyB, that triggerId is activated
Each triggerId can have multiple events associated with it (eg. Text is activated and some condition is checked)

PhysObjs are used to detect when an object with a tag hits a trigger. 
When it's activated, the TriggerEvent function associated with that trigger is executed

ColourID for each dimension
    1 - Red
    2 - Blue
    3 - Green
    4 - Yellow

bolded font ->: final statement (click to dismiss)
red = default

bridge: L3

death triggers:
    L3: die in gap

YOU STAY IN A DIMENSION AFTER DEATH


phase -> move item DIMENSION

unexepcted key changes after each level

DIMENSIONS COLLAPSE AFTER 15 SECONDS

/usr/share/apport/apport -p%p -s%s -c%c -d%d -P%P -u%u -g%g -- %E


lvl7 -> fade to black "do you really think you can escape you can't" fade out to "the end"


TODO: Press any key to cancel textBox

boss will have boss bar
how attack work - spacebar to cycle DIMENSIONS
